# Introduction

In this homework assignment, you will be implementing simple statistical functions. See how `cout` and `cin` are used, how a header file is used, and how functions are called. 

# Tasks

1. Receive three numbers using `cin`. Do this in the main() function. You may assume that only integers are entered. 

2. Compute the median by implementing the median() function in stats.cpp. Call the function in main() and print out the result using `cout`. Refer to stats.h for its return data type and parameters.

4. Repeat for max

5. Repeat for min

# Compile

1. Type the following commands on Terminal.
```
g++ -o main *.cpp *.h
```
```
./main
```

2. Enter three integers and check if your result is correct.

# Submission

Please upload your `main.cpp` and `stats.cpp` files to `myCourses > Assignments > Homework 1`. Do not submit *.docx, *.pdf, *.txt, or *.zip file.
